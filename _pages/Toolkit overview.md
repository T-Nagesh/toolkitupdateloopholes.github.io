# ENGAGEMENT

Stakeholder engagement is the practice of actively including and collaborating with various groups such as consumers, employees, suppliers, local communities, and NGOs. It's about building transparent, constructive dialogues, embracing different viewpoints, and tackling social and environmental issues. Through stakeholder engagement, fashion brands can cultivate trust, inspire societal advancements, and ensure their strategies resonate with the broader community expectations.
